# AGNallskycat_Veronesi23
All-Sky AGN catalogue described in Veronesi+23. 

This catalogue has been created starting from unWISE (Schlafly+19) and Milliquas (Flesch21).

All the objects have a spectroscopic measurement of redshift below z=0.3, and a calculated bolometric luminosity greater than 10^45 erg/s.

Name: ID from the Literature, or J2000 (same as Milliquas v7.7b)

Cite: Citation for Name (same as Milliquas v7.7b)

z: Spectroscopic redshift

IDunWISE: unWISE identifier

RA: Right Ascension [deg] J2000

Dec: Declination [deg] J2000

W1mag: Magnitude in the W1 band

W2mag: Magnitude in the W2 band

lumbol: bolometric luminosity [erg/s]. This is calculated starting from the luminosity in the W1 band, using a bolometric correction of 10.
